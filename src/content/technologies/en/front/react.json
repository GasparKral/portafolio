    "description": "ReactJS (commonly known as React) is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook. It is primarily used for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces (UIs) for web applications. Its core concept is the use of reusable components—self-contained pieces of code that manage their own logic and appearance. React is known for its use of a virtual DOM, which makes updating the user interface highly efficient and fast.",
